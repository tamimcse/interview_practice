Arista Network

Remove duplicate elements from a circular linked list and the duplicates occur consecutively in the list. It was tricky because of the edge case that the last element could be equal to the first element and since linked list is circular.


Remove adjacent elements from circular linked list if they are same.

     eg - Input - 1 1 2 2 3 4 1
            Output- 1 2 3 4 

Tricky part was that the last element is adjacent to first element in Circular Linked List

Create Singly link list to Doubly link list.

Create Singly link list to Doubly link list where prev pointer of an ith node will be pointing to (i- step)th node, the step will be given in run-time. 
for all i < step, prev will be null.

Find a cycle in a Directed Graph.


Given Sum and Count. You can use the only integer from 1-9 (can use more than one time) to make the Sum. The restriction is that the number of the element should be equal to Count. Find all possible combinations.
Example:
Sum = 10 and Count = 2
Result is (1, 9), (2, 8), (3, 7), (4, 6) and (5, 5)
1 + 9 = 10
2 + 8 = 10
3 + 7 = 10
4 + 6 = 10
5 + 5 = 10

Given a 2D array having 0s and 1s where all 0s in each row preceed before all 1s. Find a row having max nos of 1s .

Given two integers which can be represented as 32bit numbers and a start index and an end index, copy the bits of one integer to another within the given start and end index

Given n intervals with start and finish time and a global interval [globalStart, globalFinish], find all intervals which overlaps with the global interval.

There is a pipe dealer who has got pipes of different lengths (two pipes may be of same length). He wants to sell his stock. He can only sell his stock such that the length of each pipe will be same. For eg. If length of pipes in his inventory are a=14, b=7, c=6 and he decides to sell pipes of length 7, then he can sell pipe b unchanged. He can cut pipe a, to get two pipes of length 7 each. But the pipe c=6 will be wasted. Suppose that the cost of each unit length of pipe is x and the cost of cutting a rod is y per cut ( so if we have d=21 then we need two cuts, so cost of cutting will be 2y). The cost for cutting is a loss to the dealer. We need to find the optimum length which he can sell to achieve maximum profit.
Note : say there are pipes of length 7, 11, 13 etc. he may choose selling length=7.56 i.e a length corresponding to which no pipe is present i.e every pipe needs to be cut.

Given an array which was sorted initially but then it was rotated at a point, find an element in it

Perform BFS traversal using recursion

Suppose there are 3 players and 1 coin(with Head and Tail). Devise a strategy such that we can have a clear winner. Probability of winning should be same for every player. The coin may be tossed any number of times.

N sorted arrays are given. Combine them to get an overall sorted array. You can assume arrays to be of same size.

Say we have a register of n bits. the character ‘A’ occupies 1 bit, character ‘B’ occupies 2 bit. How many different words can be formed?

	        e.g n=3 :
		possibilities : 	AB, AAA, BA 
		Output: 3
		hint : Think Recursive


Given n intervals, each interval having start and end time, check if any two intervals overlap or not.
