Print all the substrings which occurs more than one time in the string

Infix evaluation

The puzzle was, I was given an 8*8 chessboard and the top rightmost box and bottom leftmost boxes were removed, and I was given a rectangle of 2*1 dimension. So I was asked that whether I could fill the above chessboard with the given rectangle completely or not.   

The second puzzle he asked me was what is the probability of getting all correct answers in an MCQ quiz in which each question has 4 choices and there are 50 questions in total.


1. You were given a list of strings which indicated at what time of the day an employee of a company checked in and checked out of the company on a particular day.  Input was in the form of <Employee_Name>, <In_Time>, <Out_Time> (comma separated).
Eg:       
Alice,10:23:02,13:04:45
Bob,09:00:43,12:03:21
The time was always in HH:MM:SS 24-hours format. You were given a time of the day as query <Query_Time> Eg: 11:00:56. We have to determine how many numbers of employees were present inside the company at the point in time (Query_Time). In these examples, o/p should be 2 (Reason: Alice and Bob both are inside the office at time 11:00:56).

2. You were given a 3×3 matrix consisting of numbers between 1- 9. Finally, you have to arrange the matrix in the following format
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
In the original matrix, only the following operations were allowed to convert the matrix.
Operation – You can exchange two adjacent numbers only if their sum is a prime number.
Find the minimum number of exchanges needed to reach the final(goal) matrix.

3. The question was to print a pattern based on an integer. 
Eg:
I/P:  4   O/P: 4321 - 4321 - 4321 - 4321

I/P:  3   O/P: 321 - 321 - 321
The interviewer checked for all the corner cases and made sure it worked for a set of inputs.
Then he switched over to theory questions:

4. An array implementation problem wherein you were supposed to find the number of intervals inside the target interval.

32. I said that suppose there is a postman who needs to visit 7 cities and deliver posts with a constraint of covering the minimum distance in doing so. Such a scenario can be represented using Graphs. His next counter question was Can you help the postman? I said Yes I can I can generate the minimum spanning tree using the Prim’s or Kruskal’s Algorithm and ask the postman to go accordingly. Then he asked me Can you explain how these algorithms work? I was unable to answer this question since I had not prepared this part. But I said that sir I can explain the Dijkstra Algorithm to find the minimum distance from a source to a destination, and I explained that to him.
