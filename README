Print all the substrings which occurs more than one time in the string


1. You were given a list of strings which indicated at what time of the day an employee of a company checked in and checked out of the company on a particular day.  Input was in the form of <Employee_Name>, <In_Time>, <Out_Time> (comma separated).
Eg:       
Alice,10:23:02,13:04:45
Bob,09:00:43,12:03:21
The time was always in HH:MM:SS 24-hours format. You were given a time of the day as query <Query_Time> Eg: 11:00:56. We have to determine how many numbers of employees were present inside the company at the point in time (Query_Time). In these examples, o/p should be 2 (Reason: Alice and Bob both are inside the office at time 11:00:56).

2. You were given a 3×3 matrix consisting of numbers between 1- 9. Finally, you have to arrange the matrix in the following format
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
In the original matrix, only the following operations were allowed to convert the matrix.
Operation – You can exchange two adjacent numbers only if their sum is a prime number.
Find the minimum number of exchanges needed to reach the final(goal) matrix.

3. The question was to print a pattern based on an integer. 
Eg:
I/P:  4   O/P: 4321 - 4321 - 4321 - 4321

I/P:  3   O/P: 321 - 321 - 321
The interviewer checked for all the corner cases and made sure it worked for a set of inputs.
Then he switched over to theory questions:

12. the expression paranthesised in such a way that it give max value for the expression. Expression has +, -, *

this is variation of matrix chain multiplication.

17. Find whether a given tree is a sub-tree of another

18. I said that suppose there is a postman who needs to visit 7 cities and deliver posts with a constraint of covering the minimum distance in doing so. Such a scenario can be represented using Graphs. His next counter question was Can you help the postman? I said Yes I can I can generate the minimum spanning tree using the Prim’s or Kruskal’s Algorithm and ask the postman to go accordingly. Then he asked me Can you explain how these algorithms work? I was unable to answer this question since I had not prepared this part. But I said that sir I can explain the Dijkstra Algorithm to find the minimum distance from a source to a destination, and I explained that to him.
