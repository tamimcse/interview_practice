Print all the substrings which occurs more than one time in the string


1. You were given a list of strings which indicated at what time of the day an employee of a company checked in and checked out of the company on a particular day.  Input was in the form of <Employee_Name>, <In_Time>, <Out_Time> (comma separated).
Eg:       
Alice,10:23:02,13:04:45
Bob,09:00:43,12:03:21
The time was always in HH:MM:SS 24-hours format. You were given a time of the day as query <Query_Time> Eg: 11:00:56. We have to determine how many numbers of employees were present inside the company at the point in time (Query_Time). In these examples, o/p should be 2 (Reason: Alice and Bob both are inside the office at time 11:00:56).

2. You were given a 3×3 matrix consisting of numbers between 1- 9. Finally, you have to arrange the matrix in the following format
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
In the original matrix, only the following operations were allowed to convert the matrix.
Operation – You can exchange two adjacent numbers only if their sum is a prime number.
Find the minimum number of exchanges needed to reach the final(goal) matrix.
