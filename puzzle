The puzzle was, I was given an 8*8 chessboard and the t, and I was given a rectangle of 2*1 dimension. So I was asked that whether I could fill the above chessboard with the given rectangle completely or not.   

The second puzzle he asked me was what is the probability of getting all correct answers in an MCQ quiz in which each question has 4 choices and there are 50 questions in total.
