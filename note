1. To include "match.h", need to use -lm to compile

2. In backtracking algorithms, the inner algorithm should not return anything. The inner algorithm should return the outout as input.

3. cmp in qsort():

int cmp (const void *a, const void *b)
{
  return *((int *)a) - *((int *)b);
}

3. qsort prototype: qsort(arr, len, sizeof(arr[0]), cmp);

4. When returning char *, note that char * should also include '\0'. So, when allocating it, allocate one character extra.

5. when assigning NULL to an element of char *, assign '\0' instead;

6. Note that, you need to include 'string.h' in order to use memcpy.

7. memcpy prototype: memcpy(void *dest, const void * src, size_t n);

8. remember that there are sprintf () and scanf ().

9. ASCII table has 256 characxters

9. When dealing with equation with index, double check if your equation needs "- 1".

10. Remember what palindrome and anagram means. Two strings are anagrams if their character count of each character is same for the two string. For instance, eat, ate and tea are anagram. 

11. *returnColumnSizes[i] is not right . It should be (*returnColumnSizes)[i].

12. Adjacency matrix may look easier than adjacency list, but they are really not. So, don't try to use adjacency matrix because it's easier. Besides, adjacency matrix requires looping through each element to the matrix row which cause to exceed time limit for large matrix.

13. Sometimes, a problem can be solved using graph. But, it can be solved not using graph and the version is more efficient.
