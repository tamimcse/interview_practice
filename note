1. To include "match.h", need to use -lm to compile

2. In backtracking algorithms, the inner algorithm should not return anything. The inner algorithm should return the outout as input.

3. cmp in qsort():

int cmp (const void *a, const void *b)
{
  return *((int *)a) - *((int *)b);
}

3. qsort prototype: qsort(arr, len, sizeof(arr[0]), cmp);

4. When returning char *, note that char * should also include '\0'. So, when allocating it, allocate one character extra.

5. when assigning NULL to an element of char *, assign '\0' instead;

6. Note that, you need to include 'string.h' in order to use memcpy.

7. memcpy prototype: memcpy(void *dest, const void * src, size_t n);

8. remember that there are sprintf () and scanf ().

9. ASCII table has 256 characxters
